Working as a front end developer within Apple Marketing, I've helped to make many different pages on apple.com. I'm not permitted to publicly showcase what I was the developer on, but I encourage you to ask questions.

I was also able to work as a creative technologist prototyping a large scale installation for Apple. You should also ask me about that!
