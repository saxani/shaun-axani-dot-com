  Vereday is a browser extension that seamlessly offers sustainable shopping alternatives. While shopping on Amazon, if Vereday has products in its database that matches what a user is searching for, it will alert them and show options. Based on recommendations from others, and given a user's priorities (i.e. Organic, sustainable packaging, etc), it becomes possible for someone who wants to make sustainble decisions the opportunity to do so at point-of-sale.

  Two successful co-founders in Silicon Valley approached me with the concept, and it intrigued me. I built the entire site using a modern stack and tooling. Further plans include expanding to be a multi-browser extension and working with online shopping sites besides Amazon. We'd also like to utilize image recognition to further match sustainable suggestions beyond just keywords.
