The Quinn Experiments is an interactive experience that combines immersive performance with escape room-inspired gamification. It takes an interchangeable story and lets users determine their own fate. Participants are equipped with headsets and act as the main characters: technicians who enter a mysterious laboratory and bring an artificial intelligence system back online after an unknown mishap. Their employer guides them along in headphones. As more information is uncovered, the users must decide who they can trust in order to survive.
